Pandemic # Just like others, online school is boring. So i started to learn game development. I started with Godot Engine since its lite and doesn\u0026rsquo;t need a lot of resources. I started with a simple game, a platformer game.\nAGI # Then coincidentally a few months later AGI held a Game Development Competition. So i decided to join the competition. The theme of the competition is Educational Game for Vocational Training. I made an educational game about coffee industry for Kementerian Ketenagakerjaan, it narrates how Luwak made coffee from coffee plantation. Won second place despite being the only high school and able to beat a team of 3 people from vocational high school by myself, it was turning point for me.\nHere is the clip of the game called Luwak Adventure that i made:\nCompfest 14 # After the competition, i decided to join another competition. This time it\u0026rsquo;s Compfest 14. I formed a small team consist of 3 people. We decided to make a game about metroidvania. For 30 days of struggle sadly we didn\u0026rsquo;t make it through the final. But we still proud of our work and we try to do it better next time. Mainly i\u0026rsquo;m the one who did the game design, UI programming, and some of the art. Deka for the more complex programming such as the platformer physics, game mechanics, he also compose the music and draw the main character. Others is Zio for pixel artist and Azfa for additional programming and level design.\nHere is the clip of the game we made called May I Return that we made:\nGACCI 2022 # After Compfest 14, i decided to join another competition. This time it\u0026rsquo;s GACCI 2022. Another competition show up, this time it\u0026rsquo;s a competition held by Binus University. This competition is a bit different from the previous one. This time we have to make a game design document(which i never did before), so i eager to learn what is game design document. I got into the final and some of my friends from AGI Competition also get into the final. We have to do sort of game pitching for the jury. I got the 1st place and my friends got the 2nd place. Apparently i made it to the final because of my game design document is the longest and the most complex one. I tried to make a fusion game of Papers Please and Cooking Mama on Indonesian Independence Day theme. The prize is a fullscholarship for Binus University.\nGIM JAM ITB 2023 # It\u0026rsquo;s a 7 days game jam basicly, with the theme of \u0026ldquo;Meme Indonesia\u0026rdquo;. I made a game about Meth, Magician, and Latto-latto. Because meme is vary, i decided to put 3 meme in one game. I made it to become the Winner of Best Game Award. I made this game with Deka, Zio. We made this game using kinematic skeleton to animate the character, it\u0026rsquo;s save a lot of time.\nGlobal Game Jam 2023 # It\u0026rsquo;s a 48 hours offline game jam with \u0026ldquo;Root\u0026rdquo; as a theme. The event supported by GameLan.YK, I made the level design based on the Team Lead direction and searched for some audio assets for the game. I met a lot of new people and had a lot of fun, we got a visit from Kementerian Pariwisata dan Ekonomi Kreatif, Muhammad Neil El Himam and Sandiaga Uno.\nHere is the clip of the game we made called Stay Hydrated! that we made:\nand here is the recap of the event:\nTono # My experiment for 3D game, probably my shamest work. I made this game for Vocachamp 2023. Made with the new Godot Engine 4, 3D assets with Blender, audio with BeepBox, drawing with Krita, video editing software with KDEnLive. I made a Hamster Ball game like. Beside my shamest work i also proud of this work because i made it all by myself. I made the 3D assets, the music, the sound effect, the game design, the programming, the level design, the UI, the video editing, and the game trailer. I made this game in 2 weeks.\n","date":"1 January 2024","permalink":"/posts/school-chaos/","section":"Posts","summary":"I made this blog for my past project that i do when i was on highschool.
