__Why this game is so fun and addictive? Let's break it down.__

### Simple Gameplay

The rules, initially appearing complex, quickly become intuitive with an interactive tutorial, making Marvel Snap easy to learn and play. The game's fast-paced nature, with each turn lasting only 30 seconds, ensures that players are constantly engaged. The game's short duration also makes it ideal for mobile devices, allowing players to enjoy a quick game on the go.

### Visuals and Sound Effects

Stunning visuals exemplified in every unique card, contribute to a captivating gaming experience. The game's vibrant colors and dynamic animations further enhance the visual appeal every turn you play or interact with the game. The music however, is a bit repetitive and could be improved, such as adding more tracks or allowing players to choose their own music, just like what Valve did on [Counter-Strike 2](https://www.counter-strike.net/cs2). Unlike the music, the sound effects are well-designed and add to the overall experience. Especially the sound effects of the cards, which are unique to each card and are very satisfying to hear.

### Card Collection and Leveling System

Since Marvel Snap has a lot of cards, it's make the game more dynamic and fun. You cannot expect what card your opponent will play next. So it feels like a gamble, but a fun gamble. The extensive card variety and leveling system, achievable through in-game currency or casual play, add dynamic and unpredictable elements to the game. Player could upgrade their cards to higher rarity, which won't increase the power of the card, but will unlock new card animations and sound effects.

### Regular Updates and Active Community
